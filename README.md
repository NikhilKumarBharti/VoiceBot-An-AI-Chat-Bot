## 🚀 Super Easy Setup Guide

### Step 1: Check if You Have Python
First, let's see if Python is already installed on your computer:

**Windows Users:**
1. Press `Windows Key + R`
2. Type `cmd` and press Enter
3. Type `python --version` and press Enter

**Mac Users:**
1. Press `Cmd + Space` to open Spotlight
2. Type `Terminal` and press Enter
3. Type `python3 --version` and press Enter

**What you should see:** Something like `Python 3.8.5` or higher numbers.

**Don't see Python?** No worries! Download it from https://python.org/downloads/ and choose the latest version.

### Step 2: Install Required Tools

**For Windows Users (IMPORTANT!):**
1. **Install Chocolatey** (a package manager that makes life easier):
   - Open Command Prompt **as Administrator** (right-click on Command Prompt → "Run as administrator")
   - Copy and paste this command:
   ```
   @"%SystemRoot%\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe" -NoProfile -InputFormat None -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Command "iex ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://chocolatey.org/install.ps1'))" && SET "PATH=%PATH%;%ALLUSERSPROFILE%\chocolatey\bin"
   ```
   - Press Enter and wait for it to finish

2. **Install FFmpeg** (needed for voice processing):
   ```bash
   choco install ffmpeg
   ```
   - If it asks for permission, type `Y` and press Enter

**For Mac Users:**
1. **Install Homebrew** (if you don't have it):
   ```bash
   /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
   ```
2. **Install FFmpeg**:
   ```bash
   brew install ffmpeg
   ```

**For Linux Users:**
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install ffmpeg
```

### Step 3: Download the Project
1. **Download** the project files to your computer (from GitHub or wherever you got them)
2. **Extract** the zip file if needed
3. **Remember** where you saved it (like Desktop or Documents)

### Step 4: Set Up Your Workspace
1. **Open Terminal/Command Prompt**
2. **Navigate to your project folder**:
   ```bash
   cd Desktop/voice_bot
   ```
   (Replace `Desktop/voice_bot` with wherever you saved the project)

3. **Create a safe environment** for the project:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```

4. **Activate the environment**:
   
   **Windows:**
   ```bash
   venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
   
   **Mac/Linux:**
   ```bash
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```
   
   **Success sign:** You should see `(venv)` at the beginning of your command line.

### Step 5: Install the Bot's Dependencies
Think of this like installing all the apps your phone needs:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**This might take a few minutes.** Don't worry if you see lots of text scrolling by!

### Step 6: Get Your AI Powers (Optional but Recommended)
To make your bot super smart, you'll want an API key:

1. **Visit** https://openrouter.ai
2. **Sign up** for a free account
3. **Create an API key** (look for "API Keys" in your dashboard)
4. **Copy** your API key (it looks like a long string of letters and numbers)

5. **Create a secret file**:
   - In your project folder, create a new file called `.env`
   - Open it with any text editor (like Notepad)
   - Add these lines:
   ```
   OPENROUTER_API_KEY="your-api-key-goes-here"
   OPENROUTER_MODEL="model/model-name-version"
   ```
   - Replace `your-api-key-goes-here` with your actual API key
   - Save the file

**Don't have an API key?** No problem! The bot will still work with built-in responses.

### Step 7: Launch Your Bot! 🚀
```bash
python app.py
```

**You should see something like:**
```
 * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000
 * Debug mode: on
```

### Step 8: Start Chatting!
1. **Open your web browser** (Chrome or Edge work best)
2. **Go to:** `http://localhost:5000`
3. **Allow microphone access** when your browser asks
4. **Start chatting!** Try typing "Hello" or clicking "Start Voice"

## 🔧 Troubleshooting (When Things Go Wrong)

### 🎤 "My microphone isn't working!"
- **Check browser permissions:** Look for a microphone icon in your address bar
- **Try a different browser:** Chrome and Edge work best
- **Check your microphone:** Make sure it's plugged in and working
- **Use HTTPS:** Some browsers require secure connections for microphone access

### 🔊 "I can't hear the bot talking!"
- **Check your speakers/headphones:** Make sure audio is working
- **Check browser volume:** Look for audio controls in your browser
- **Try refreshing the page:** Sometimes helps reset audio

### ❌ "I'm getting error messages!"
- **API key issues:** Make sure your `.env` file is set up correctly
- **No internet:** The bot needs internet for smart responses
- **Python errors:** Make sure you followed all the installation steps

### 🐛 "Something's not working and I don't know why!"
1. **Close everything** and start over from Step 7
2. **Check your command line** for error messages in red
3. **Make sure your virtual environment is activated** (you should see `(venv)`)
4. **Try these commands**:
   ```bash
   pip install --upgrade pip
   pip install -r requirements.txt --force-reinstall
   ```
