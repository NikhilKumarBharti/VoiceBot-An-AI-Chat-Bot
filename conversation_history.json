    "assistant_response": "Swami Vivekananda (1863â€“1902) was a towering spiritual leader, philosopher, and one of the most influential figures in modern India. Born as **Narendranath Datta** in Kolkata, he became the chief disciple of the mystic **Sri Ramakrishna Paramahamsa** and played a key role in introducing Indian philosophies of Vedanta and Yoga to the Western world.  \n\n### **Key Contributions and Teachings:**  \n1. **Vedanta and Universal Religion:**  \n   - Vivekananda emphasized the unity of all religions and the idea that every soul is divine. His famous speech at the **1893 Parliament of Religions in Chicago** began with \"Sisters and Brothers of America,\" captivating audiences with his message of tolerance and universal brotherhood.  \n   - He taught **Advaita Vedanta** (non-dualism), asserting that the ultimate reality (Brahman) is one, and all diversity is an expression of the same truth.  \n\n2. **Social Reform and Nation-Building:**  \n   - He believed in **practical spirituality**â€”serving humanity as a form of worship (\"Serve man as God\"). This inspired the **Ramakrishna Mission**, founded by him in 1897, which works in education, healthcare, and rural development.  \n   - He urged Indians to embrace **self-confidence, education, and scientific temper** while staying rooted in their spiritual heritage.  \n\n3. **Youth Empowerment:**  \n   - Vivekanandaâ€™s teachings heavily focused on **fearlessness, self-discipline, and action**. His famous quote: *\"Arise, awake, and stop not till the goal is reached\"* remains a rallying cry for motivation.  \n   - He encouraged the youth to develop both **physical strength** and **intellectual rigor**.  \n\n4. **Legacy:**  \n   - His books (**\"Raja Yoga,\" \"Karma Yoga,\" \"Jnana Yoga,\" \"Bhakti Yoga\"**) are global spiritual classics.  \n   - His birthday (**January 12**) is celebrated as **National Youth Day in India**.  \n   - Institutions like the **Ramakrishna Math and Mission** continue his work worldwide.  \n\n### **Why He Matters Today:**  \nVivekanandaâ€™s vision blends **spirituality with rationality**, making his teachings timeless. His emphasis on **service, unity, and human potential** resonates in an increasingly divided world.  \n\nWould you like to explore a specific aspect of his life or philosophy? ðŸ˜Š",
